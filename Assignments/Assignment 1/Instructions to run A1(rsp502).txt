To get the output of the picture frame called slideshow, Just extract the zip file then,

A1(rsp502)-> src -> sample -> And run the Main.java file and that should bring it up.


There are two buttons at the bottom of the screen to control the slideshow and manual 
function and also to pause thhe slideshow if you want to. This is at the very bottom and sometimes get misses as the screen size is 1920*1080.
